\section{Linear Graphs and Rates of Change (Section 2.2)}

\textbf{Linear Equation} - a \textit{linear equation} is any equation that can be written in the form
\newline

\centerline{$ax + by = c$}

where $a,b,c$ are real numbers 

{\bf \underline{Intercepts}}
\begin{myindentpar}{1cm}
\textbf{Y-intercept} - the point where a graph passes through the y-axis. To find the y-intercept we set $x=0$ and solve for $y$

\textbf{X-intercept} - the point where a graph passes through the x-axis. To find the x-intercept we set $y=0$ and solve for $x$
\end{myindentpar}

{\bf \underline{Lines:}}
\begin{myindentpar}{1cm}
\textbf{Slope of a Line: } Given two different points $(x_{1},y_{1})$ and $(x_{2}, y_{2})$ the \textit{slope} of the line connecting these two points is given by
\newline

\centerline{$m = \dfrac{y_{2} - y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}$}
\vspace{.5cm}

\textbf{Parallel Lines:} two lines are parallel if they have the same slope
\vspace{.5cm}

\textbf{Perpendicular Lines:} two lines are perpendicular if the slope of one line is the \textbf{negative reciprocal} of the slope of the other line

\vspace{.5cm}

\textbf{Horizontal Lines:} the equation of a horizontal line is given by
\newline

\centerline{$y = k$} 

where $k$ is some real number. The \textbf{slope of a horizontal line is always 0.}

\vspace{.5cm}

\textbf{Vertical Lines:} the equation of a vertical line is given by
\newline

\centerline{$x = h$} 

where $h$ is some real number. The \textbf{slope of a vertical line is always undefined.}
\end{myindentpar}

\section{Graphs and Special Forms of Linear Equations (Section 2.3)}

\textbf{Point-Slope Equation of a Line:} The line with slope $m$ passing through $(x_{1}, y_{1})$ is given by
\newline

\centerline{$y - y_{1} = m(x-x_{1})$}
\vspace{.5cm}

\textbf{Slope Intercept Equation of a Line:} The line with slope $m$ has a slope-intercept form of 
\newline

\centerline{$y = mx+b$ \hspace{1cm} where (0,b) is the y-intercept}
