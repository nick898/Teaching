\title{Internet Resources}

\maketitle

Ok, the internet is an awesome resource for LOTS of different things. And in the past few years it's become an increasingly useful tool for answering all sorts of mathematical questions from the most basic questions to the most difficult and abstract mathematical topics. I thought I'd compile a list of some of the best resources I've found. The list will be a general list...sort of an all purpose list of websites where you can go and watch videos on relevant math problems or ask questions or read example problems. I will update this as I discover more and more websites so if you download it, you may miss future updates. Obviously, as your TA I should be your go to person for answering math questions pertaining to this course but sometimes I am not available or I simply suck at answering your question! In those cases, here are some websites you can visit for help:

\textbf{General Resources:}

\href{https://www.khanacademy.org/math}{Khan Academy - Math} - huge collection of videos covering many, many mathematical topics

\href{http://math.stackexchange.com/}{Mathematics Stack Exchange} - question/answer site for mathematical questions at any level

\href{http://www.reddit.com/r/cheatatmathhomework}{Reddit - CAMH} - question/answer site...also reddit is just fun in general

\href{http://www.reddit.com/r/learnmath}{Reddit - Learn Math} - question/answer site...different subreddit

\href{http://www.wolframalpha.com/}{Wolfram Alpha} - computational knowledge engine/not quite sure how to describe this, but it's awesome

\href{https://www.mathway.com/}{MathWay} - interactive math website

\href{http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/}{Paul's Online Math Notes} - large collection of worked through examples with explanations

\href{https://www.youtube.com/user/patrickJMT}{patrickJMT Youtube} - Youtube channel with lots and lots of videos with clear explanations. I often watched his videos as an undergrad. 

\href{https://www.youtube.com/user/mathbff/videos}{mathbff - Youtube} - Youtube channel with quite a few videos. Not as much as patrickJMT, but the explanations are clear and concise

\href{https://www.youtube.com/user/teachertubemath/featured}{TeacherTubeMath - Youtube} - lots and lots of videos although it's kind of disorganized and some of the videos may be a bit boring

\href{http://mymathforum.com/}{My Math Forum} - question/answers forum...never used it...seems helpful though

\textbf{Math Websites for Fun}

If you have some time to kill...these websites won't help you out very much, but they are actually quite interesting and accessible even for people who hate math

\href{https://www.youtube.com/user/numberphile}{Numberphile}

\href{https://www.youtube.com/user/Vihart/videos}{Vi Hart - Youtube } 

\href{https://www.youtube.com/user/tecmath}{Tecmath - Youtube} - all sorts of neat fast mathematical tricks
